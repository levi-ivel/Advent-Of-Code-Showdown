# Advent of Code Showdown
Every year during Advent of Code, I challenge people to see who can come out on top in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 
We compete according to the rules below, along with an added gimmick that changes every year.

You can find all the showsdowns here:
- [2025 Advent of Code Showdown](./2025/README.md)


# Rules
The rules are simple:

- The code for a day's solution can only be written during the first 24 hours after the puzzle is released, no more updates afterwards

- When the 24 hours are up, we run the solutions we made on our and the competitor's machines 10 times and take the average time to finish

- The ranking is determined by going from the shortest to the longest average time across all puzzles

- No AI allowed for solution oriented tasks (code generation, questions about the puzzle, etc)
